ðŸ“‚ Example Project: Dynamic Scaling Demo

Hereâ€™s a simplified demonstration of per-player mob scaling:

Player A (Level 30) fights a mob with 300 HP

Player B (Level 25) fights the same mob but sees 250 HP

Damage is projected individually, so each player experiences balanced combat


ðŸ‘‰ Demo plugin code will be available soon here in this repo.
